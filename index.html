        <h1>Hello Java Script</h1>
        <p id ="text">JavaScript (or "JS") is a programming language used most often for dynamic client-side <br>
            scripts on webpages, <br>
            but it is also often used on the server-side, using a runtime such as Node.js. <br>
            JavaScript should not be confused with the Java programming language. Although "Java" and <br>
            "JavaScript" are trademarks (or registered trademarks) of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries, <br>
            the two programming languages are significantly different in their syntax, semantics, and use cases. <br>
            <span id="moreText" style="display: none;"> 
            JavaScript is primarily used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through <br>
            the DOM, retrieve content from servers using the fetch() API, store complex data using IndexedDB, <br>
            draw graphics <br>
            with canvas, interact with the device running the browser through various APIs, <br>
            and more. JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages, owing to <br>
            the recent growth and performance improvement of APIs available in browsers. <br>
            <strong>Origins and History</strong> <br>
            Conceived as a server-side language by Brendan Eich (then employed by the Netscape Corporation), <br> 
            JavaScript soon came to Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. JavaScript enjoyed immediate success <br>
            and Internet Explorer 3.0 introduced JavaScript support under the name JScript in August 1996.
            In November 1996, <br>
             Netscape began working with Ecma International to make JavaScript an industry standard. <br>
         Since then, the standardized JavaScript is called ECMAScript and specified under ECMA-262, whose latest (fourteenth, ES2023) edition is available as of June 2023.
